## Overview

Financial data is highly diverse and varies across multiple dimensions:

* **Structure:** structured vs. unstructured
* **Frequency:** low-frequency (quarterly, annual) to high-frequency (tick-level)
* **Accessibility:** public vs. private
* **Complexity:** raw data vs. derived analytics

Traditional financial data is increasingly **complemented by alternative data**, significantly expanding the information set available to investors.
