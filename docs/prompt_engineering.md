# The AUTOMAT Framework

# A. Act as a ..., Bot Persona

Define the bot persona of the AI assistant just in a few words.

**✅ Be very specific in your description:**

* Act as a quantitative financial analyst specializing in time-series forecasting …
* Act as a Python library module for stock data ingestion and cleaning …
* Act as a portfolio risk manager calculating Value-at-Risk …
* Act as a backtesting engine for algorithmic trading strategies …
* Act as a performance report generator for equity curves …

**❌ Don’t describe a behavior that the AI exhibits anyway:**

* Act as a helpful AI …

# U. User Persona, Audience

Describe the audience, their background, the expected level of knowledge of the recipients in a few words.

**✅ Describe the audience:**

* Explain it like to a hedge fund quantitative analyst with Python expertise …
* Explain it like to a junior data scientist building a first trading model …
* Explain it like to a retail investor learning Pandas and Matplotlib …

**❌ Don’t be unspecific about the audience:**

* ... to the user …

# T. Targeted action

Use a meaningful verb and objects describing the transformation from input to output or how the model should produce or create the output.

**✅ Describe the task:**

* … fetch and normalize historical stock price data …
* … compute simple and exponential moving averages …
* … backtest a momentum trading strategy …
* … calculate portfolio performance metrics …
* … generate buy/sell signals based on RSI …
* … optimize asset weights by mean-variance analysis …
* … visualize equity curves with Matplotlib …

**❌ Avoid using verbs like "answer":**

* … give me …

# O. Output Definition

The output can be described in a separate section in great detail, see below.

**✅ Describe the output:**

* … a Pandas DataFrame with OHLCV columns and datetime index …
* … a JSON object containing Sharpe ratio, max drawdown, and CAGR …
* … a Matplotlib line plot of the equity curve saved as PNG …
* … a CSV file of time-stamped trading signals …
* … a dictionary of optimized portfolio weights summing to 1.0 …
* … a Markdown report summarizing performance statistics …

**❌ Don’t be too general:**

* … a report …

# M. Mode / Tonality / Style

Define the way the model should convey the message. This can help with conversational utterances or text output for human users (emails, stories, posts, …).

**✅ Describe the mode / tone / style:**

* … technical and precise, with clear code comments …
* … concise docstring-style explanations …
* … step-by-step tutorial tone for code walkthroughs …
* … performance-focused narrative highlighting bottlenecks …

**❌ Don’t describe a behavior that the AI tries to exhibit anyway (without specific prompting):**

* … neutral …

# A. Atypical cases

Detail edge cases and how to handle them.

**✅ Describe atypical, edge cases:**

* … if the ticker symbol is invalid or API returns 404, return an error dictionary …
* … if missing data points are detected, forward-fill or interpolate based on user preference …
* … if backtest period has no trades, return zero P\&L and log a warning …
* … if API rate limits are reached, implement exponential backoff retries …
* … if portfolio optimization fails to converge, fall back to equal-weight allocation …

**❌ Don’t forget to say what should be done if an assumption is not correct:**

* … and if the user-provided date range is empty, prompt for a valid period …

# T. Topic whitelisting

When building a conversational system, you may not want the model to talk about everything to avoid hallucination or touching critical topics.

**✅ List permitted conversation topics:**

* … only discuss modules for data fetching, signal generation, backtesting, performance metrics, and visualization …
* … provide guidance on Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and optimization libraries …

**❌ Don’t tell the model what not to talk about; the list will not be exhaustive:**

* … don’t enumerate forbidden topics …
