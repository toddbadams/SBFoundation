The **Dividend Score** is a quantitative measure designed to assess how likely a company is to maintain or cut its dividend over a full economic cycle. It combines multiple financial indicators—such as payout ratios, debt levels, cash flow stability, and liquidity—to evaluate the underlying strength and sustainability of a firm’s dividend payments.

This score matters because high-yield dividends can be deceptively attractive; without proper risk screening, investors may unknowingly take on companies that are overleveraged, cash-flow unstable, or vulnerable in downturns. A well-structured **Dividend Score** helps avoid dividend traps, build more reliable income portfolios, and make decisions grounded in both financial discipline and long-term risk management.

The composite score is structured as:

* **Financial Sustainability Score (70%)** 
* **Dividend Policy Score (30%)** 


# **Financial Sustainability Score**

These assess a company’s *capacity* to sustain dividends through economic cycles — i.e., its solvency, liquidity, cash-flow strength, and stability.  These indicate **dividend safety**, i.e., how durable the firm’s payouts are under stress.

1. **Free Cash Flow Payout Ratio** — Tests whether dividends are supported by real cash generation.
2. **Cash Payout Ratio** — Uses operating cash flow instead of accounting earnings.
3. **Debt-to-Equity Ratio** — Measures leverage and financial flexibility.
4. **Interest to EBIT Coverage Ratio** — Gauges ability to pay interest from operating earnings.
5. **Cash (EBITDA) to Interest Coverage Ratio** — Cash-based variant showing debt-servicing strength.
6. **Cash to Dividend Coverage Ratio** — Tests if operating cash can fully fund dividends.
7. **Free Cash Flow Volatility** — Evaluates stability of cash generation over time.
8. **Revenue Drawdown** — Reflects business resilience and cyclicality.
9. **Quick Ratio** — Tests short-term liquidity.


## 1. Free Cash Flow Payout Ratio

**Free Cash Flow Payout Ratio** is the percentage of free cash flow paid out as dividends. It provides a sense of dividend sustainability, since free cash flow (FCF) is the cash a company actually has left after funding its operations and capital expenditures. A **30%** FCF payout ratio means the company is returning 30% of its available cash to shareholders, leaving 70% to fuel growth or pay down debt. Ratios above 100% could signal unsustainable dividends (i.e., paying out more than you generate), while very low ratios might suggest room to raise distributions. It is calculated on on a per-share basis:

 $$
 \text{Free Cash Flow Payout Ratio} = \frac{\text{Dividends per Share}} {\text{Free Cash Flow per Share}}
 $$

1. **Annual Dividends per Share**: the total cash dividends paid per share in a year.
2. **Annual Free Cash Flow per Share** is the company’s free cash flow divided by the number of outstanding shares over a year.

## 2. Cash Payout Ratio

The **cash payout ratio** measures the portion of a company’s **operating cash flow** that’s paid out as cash dividends over a period. Unlike the earnings payout ratio (which uses net income), this one uses the cash the business really generated—no accruals, no non-cash charges. A **25%** cash payout ratio means the company is returning one quarter of its operating-cash generation directly to shareholders. That leaves 75% in the business for growth, debt service, or other uses. Ratios above 100% might indicate unsustainable dividends (you’re paying out more than you’re actually collecting in cash), while low ratios could signal room to boost dividends or ramp up reinvestment. It is calculated on on a per-share basis:

 $$
 \text{Cash Payout Ratio} = \frac{\text{Annual Dividends per Share}} {\text{Annual Cash Flow per Share}}
 $$

1. **Annual Dividends per Share**: the total cash dividends paid per share over a year.
2. **Cash Flow per Share**: the total operating cash flow over the trailing twelve months divided by the number of outstanding shares.

## 3. Debt-to-Equity Ratio

The **debt-to-equity ratio** measures how much a company relies on debt financing compared to shareholder equity to fund its operations and growth. It’s a core gauge of financial leverage and balance-sheet risk. A ratio of **1.0** means the company has equal parts debt and equity; **0.5** means twice as much equity as debt; and **2.0** means twice as much debt as equity. Higher ratios can amplify returns when times are good—but they also magnify losses and increase insolvency risk during downturns. Lower ratios suggest a more conservative capital structure with greater financial flexibility. It is calculated as:

$$
 \text{Debt-to-Equity Ratio} = \frac{\text{Total Debt}} {\text{Shareholders’ Equity}}
$$

1. **Total Debt** Typically the sum of short-term debt (notes and lines payable within a year) plus long-term debt (bonds, loans, leases). 
2. **Shareholders’ Equity** The residual “book value” owned by shareholders: Includes common stock, retained earnings, and other equity items.

## 4. Interest to EBIT Coverage Ratio
The **interest coverage ratio** measures how many times over a company can pay its interest expense with its operating earnings. Use this ratio to compare peers in the same industry and to monitor changes over time. If interest costs rise or EBIT falls, watch for the coverage ratio slipping toward danger territory. It is calculated as:

 $$
 \text{Interest Coverage}  = \frac{\text{EBIT}} {\text{Interest Expense}}
 $$

1. **EBIT**: Earnings Before **I**nterest and **T**axes (sometimes people use **EBITDA** instead: add back Depreciation & Amortization for an “EBITDA coverage” ratio). Found on the income statement as “Operating Profit” or “Income from Operations.” If you want a more conservative view, use straight EBIT; if you want to factor in non-cash charges, you can bump it to EBITDA.
2. **Interest Expense**: The total interest the company paid (or accrued) on its borrowings over the same period. Also listed on the income statement.

## 5. Cash (EBIDTA) to Interest Coverage

The **cash (EBITDA) to interest coverage ratio** measures how many times a company’s cash earnings—represented by EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)—can cover its interest expenses. Unlike traditional interest coverage ratios that rely on EBIT (accounting profits), this one focuses on true cash-generating capacity, making it a better gauge of debt-servicing strength. A 4× ratio means the company earns four times its annual interest costs in cash terms—ample breathing room for lenders and investors alike. Ratios below 1× signal potential distress (not enough cash to pay interest), while higher ratios reflect strong solvency and flexibility. It is calculated as:

$$
\text{Cash Coverage Ratio} = \frac{\text{EBITDA}}  {\text{Interest Expense}}
$$

1. **EBITDA**: Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation & Amortization
2. **Interest Expense**: Cash interest paid over the period

## 6. Cash to Dividend Coverage Ratio

Also called the **cash dividend cover** or **dividend coverage ratio** measures how many times a company’s operating cash flow covers its dividend payments. Unlike payout ratios based on earnings, this one uses actual cash generated by the business, showing whether dividends are truly funded by operations rather than borrowing or asset sales. A 2× ratio means the company produces twice as much cash as it pays out in dividends—indicating a comfortable safety margin. Ratios near or below 1× may suggest the dividend is stretched or at risk, while higher ratios point to stronger dividend sustainability and room for potential increases. It is calculated as:

 $$
\text{Dividend Coverage Ratio} =  \frac{\text{Annual Cash Flow per Share}}  {\text{Annual Dividend per Share}}
 $$

1. **Annual Dividends per Share**: the total cash dividends paid per share over a year.
2. **Cash Flow per Share**: the total operating cash flow over the trailing twelve months divided by the number of outstanding shares.

## 7. Free Cash Flow Volatility (FCF)

The **free cash flow volatility (FCF volatility)** measures how stable or erratic a company’s free cash flow is over time. Since free cash flow represents the cash left after operating expenses and capital investments, consistent FCF signals a reliable ability to fund dividends, reduce debt, or reinvest for growth. High volatility indicates uneven or unpredictable cash generation—often a red flag for dividend safety—while low volatility reflects strong, steady performance through economic cycles. In essence, it captures how smooth or bumpy the company’s cash generation track record is. It is typically calculated as the coefficient of variation (standard deviation divided by the mean) of free cash flow over several years.

* **High volatility** → cash flow is erratic (riskier).
* **Low volatility** → cash flow is stable (more predictable).

**How FCF Volatility is calculated**

a) Gather a free cashflow time series

$$
\text{Collect FCF for n consecutive (five annual) periods:  }  \text{FCF}_1,\;\text{FCF}_2,\;\dots,\;\text{FCF}_n
$$

b) Compute the standard deviation (σ)

$$
\sigma_{\text{FCF}} = \sqrt{\frac{1}{n-1}\sum_{i=1}^n\bigl(\text{FCF}_i - \bar{\text{FCF}}\bigr)^2}
$$

where $\bar{\text{FCF}}$ is the average free cash flow over those $n$ years.

c) Normalize with the Coefficient of Variation (CV) to express volatility relative to scale, divide by the mean:

$$
 \text{CV}_{\text{FCF}} = \frac{\sigma_{\text{FCF}}}{\bar{\text{FCF}}}
$$

This yields a **unit-less** ratio (shown as a percentage).

## 8. Revenue Drawdown 

The **revenue drawdown ratio** measures the peak-to-trough decline in a company’s revenue over a given period, showing how severely sales fall during downturns before recovering. It’s a key indicator of business resilience and the stability of a firm’s top line across economic cycles. A 10% drawdown, for example, means revenue dropped 10% from its prior high before rebounding. Smaller drawdowns suggest durable demand and strong competitive positioning, while larger ones signal vulnerability to cyclical or structural shocks. It is calculated as:

1. **Gather a revenue time series**

   $$
   R_1, R_2, \dots, R_n
   $$

   where $R_i$ is revenue in period $i$.

2. **Identify peaks and troughs**

   * **Peak ($P$)**: the highest revenue value before a decline.
   * **Trough ($T$)**: the lowest point reached after that peak, before revenue rebounds or the period ends.

3. **Compute drawdown**

   $$
   \text{Drawdown} = \frac{P - T}{P} \times 100\%
   $$

   * **Numerator**: magnitude of the drop (peak minus trough).
   * **Denominator**: peak level (to normalize the drop).

## 9. Quick Ratio

The **quick ratio (also known as the acid-test ratio)** measures a company’s ability to meet its short-term liabilities using only its most liquid assets—cash, marketable securities, and receivables—while excluding inventory. It assesses how quickly a firm could cover its current obligations without relying on selling inventory or raising new funds. A 1.0 quick ratio means the company has exactly enough liquid assets to pay off its short-term debts; above 1.0 is generally considered healthy, while below 1.0 may indicate potential liquidity strain. It is calculated as:

$$
\text{Quick Ratio} = 
\frac{\text{Cash + Cash Equivalents + Marketable Securities + Accounts Receivable}}
     {\text{Current Liabilities}}
$$

 **Or equivalently:**

$$
\frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Inventory}}
     {\text{Current Liabilities}}
$$

1. **Cash & Cash Equivalents**: Ready cash or assets that can be converted to cash within 90 days.
2. **Marketable Securities**: Short-term investments you can quickly sell at fair value.
3. **Accounts Receivable**: Money owed by customers that you expect to collect soon.
4. **Current Liabilities**: Bills, loans, and other obligations due within one year.

# **Dividend Policy Score**

These reflect *management intent and behavior* — how the company distributes cash to shareholders and its commitment to growing dividends. These show **management’s dividend philosophy** — whether it favors stable, growing, or aggressive payouts.

1. **Earnings Payout Ratio** — Policy choice on how much profit is distributed.
2. **Dividend Growth Ratio (CAGR)** — Trend of dividend increases over time.
3. **Dividend Growth Streak** — Consistency of annual dividend increases.
4. **Dividend Yield** — Current cash return level; reflects policy attractiveness.
5. **Buyback Yield** — Complementary capital-return mechanism to dividends.


## 1. Earnings Payout Ratio

The **earnings payout ratio** (often called the **dividend payout ratio**) measures the portion of a company’s net income that’s paid out as dividends. It is calculated on on a per-share basis:

 $$
 \text{Earnings Payout Ratio} = \frac{\text{Annual Dividends per Share}} {\text{Annual Earnings per Share}}
 $$

 1. **Annual Dividends per Share**: the total cash dividends paid per share over a year.
 2. **Annual Earnings per Share**: is the company’s net income divided by the number of outstanding shares over a year.

## 2. Dividend Growth Ratio

The **dividend growth ratio** measures how quickly a company’s dividend per share increases over time, reflecting management’s confidence in future earnings and cash flow stability. Consistent dividend growth signals strong financial health, disciplined capital allocation, and a shareholder-friendly policy. A 5% annual growth rate, for example, means dividends are rising steadily year after year—enhancing long-term income and total return potential. Stagnant or negative growth can point to financial strain or shifting priorities. It is typically calculated as the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of dividends per share over a multi-year period.

**Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR)**: For a multi-year span ($n$ years), CAGR smooths out volatility:

   $$
   \text{Dividend CAGR} = \biggl(\frac{D_{\!n}}{D_{0}}\biggr)^{\tfrac{1}{n}} - 1
   $$

   * $D_{0}$: Dividend per share at the start.
   * $D_{n}$: Dividend per share after $n$ years.

## 3. Dividend Growth Streak

The **dividend growth streak** measures the number of consecutive years a company has increased its dividend per share without a cut or pause. It’s a hallmark of financial discipline and management’s long-term commitment to rewarding shareholders through all market conditions. A long streak—say, 10+ years—signals consistent profitability, prudent cash management, and strong cash flow reliability. Conversely, a break in the streak can indicate financial pressure or shifting capital priorities. Investors often view extended streaks as a mark of quality and stability. It is calculated as the count of uninterrupted annual dividend increases over time.

**How It’s Calculated**

1. **Gather Annual Dividends**: List the dividend per share (DPS) paid each year for the period you’re examining:

   $$
   D_0,\; D_1,\; D_2,\;\dots,\; D_n
   $$
2. **Compare Year-to-Year**: Starting from the earliest year, check whether

   $$
   D_{i} > D_{i-1}
   $$

   for each consecutive pair.
3. **Count Consecutive Increases**:

   * **Streak** = the longest run of years where each year’s dividend was strictly higher than the prior year’s.
   * If you hit a year $D_{k} \le D_{k-1}$, the streak ends there.

## 4. Dividend Yield

The dividend yield measures the annual dividend income an investor receives relative to the stock’s current market price, expressed as a percentage. It shows how much cash return you’re earning per dollar invested in the company’s shares. A 4% dividend yield, for instance, means you earn £4 annually for every £100 invested, assuming the dividend remains constant. Higher yields can look attractive but may signal elevated risk or an unsustainably high payout, while lower yields often reflect stable, growing companies that reinvest for future gains. It is calculated as:

**How It’s Calculated**

$$
 \text{Dividend Yield} = \frac{\text{Annual Dividends per Share}}{\text{Current Share Price}} \times 100\%
$$

1. **Annual Dividends per Share**: Often the sum of the last four quarterly payouts (trailing yield). Or management’s forward guidance for the next 12 months (forward yield).

2. **Current Share Price**: The market price you’d pay today for one share.


**Key Tips:**

* Compare yield to the company’s **payout ratio** and **free cash flow** to ensure sustainability.
* Track both **trailing** and **forward** yields—management may guide higher or lower payouts ahead.
* Use yield alongside **total return** (price appreciation + dividends) for a full picture of investment performance.

## 5. Buyback Yield

The **buyback yield** measures how much of a company’s market capitalization is being repurchased through share buybacks over a given period, expressed as a percentage. It reflects how aggressively management is returning capital to shareholders by reducing the number of shares outstanding—thereby boosting metrics like earnings per share (EPS) and ownership value. A 3% buyback yield, for example, means the company has repurchased shares equal to 3% of its market value within a year. High buyback yields indicate strong cash generation and shareholder focus, while low or negative yields may suggest limited capital flexibility or dilution from new share issuance. It is calculated as:


1. **Total Buyback Amount**

   $$
   \text{Buyback Amount} 
   = \sum (\text{Shares Repurchased}_i \times \text{Price Paid}_i)
   $$

   * Sum across all repurchase transactions in a period (often disclosed on the cash-flow statement).

2. **Buyback Yield** (a normalized measure)

   $$
   \text{Buyback Yield} = \frac{\text{Total Buyback Amount}}{\text{Average Market Capitalisation}} \times 100\%
   $$

   * **Average Market Cap**: often the mean of the period’s opening and closing market caps.
   * Expressed as a percentage of the company’s size, letting you compare buyback intensity across firms.

3. **Shares Outstanding Reduction**

   $$
   \Delta \text{Shares} = \text{Shares Before} - \text{Shares After}
   $$

   * You can track the percentage drop in shares: $\frac{\Delta \text{Shares}}{\text{Shares Before}}\times100\%$.
